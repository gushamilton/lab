I live in Bristol with my wife and two children. I do my clinical work at North Bristol NHS Trust and University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust.

### Background
I originally trained in Sheffield for medicine, did my foundation training in Bristol, and did academic training in infection in Bristol. I spent 6 months in New Zealand (Dunedin) doing ED, and a few months in Malawi doing general medicine.
