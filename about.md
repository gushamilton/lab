title: About Me

I live in Bristol with my wife and two children. I do my clinical work at North Bristol NHS Trust and University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust, where I consult on the microbiology service (and occasionally do a bit of ID)

### Background
I originally trained in Sheffield for medicine, did my foundation training in Bristol, and did academic training in infection in Bristol. I spent 6 months in New Zealand (Dunedin) doing ED, and a few months in Malawi doing general medicine.

My PhD was at the University of Bristol under [Nic Timpson](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/people/person/Nicholas-Timpson-cb33193a-0edb-46a8-a06f-7532cf9ee874/) FMedSciand [Peter Ghazal](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/obituaries/obituary/professor-peter-ghazal-obe-fmedsci) FMedSci, where I worked on the genetics of infection susceptibility and severity. At the same time, [David Arnold](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/people/person/David-Arnold-e7841139-4f21-4f81-bf47-556103a839cc/) and I spent a lot of time developing a respiratory infection interest that has led to a number of RCTs in pneumonia [ASPECT, n >3000 and counting] and pleural infection. Dave has done all of the work for this.

My post-doctoral time has been supervised by [George Davey Smith FRS](https://www.mrcieu.ac.uk/people/george-davey-smith/) at the MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, but I've worked closely with lots of people, including [Alex Mentzer](https://www.chg.ox.ac.uk/people/alex-mentzer) at Oxford, [Guillaume Butler-Laporte](https://www.mcgill.ca/medicine/faculty-profiles/guillaume-butler-laporte) at McGill/Oxford, [Gabrielle Pollara](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/medicine/medicine/people/gabrielle-pollara) at UCL, and a bunch of other folk.
