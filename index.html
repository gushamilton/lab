    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I am a clinical academic working at the intersection of infectious disease medicine, statistical genetics, and clinical epidemiology. My research focuses on understanding why some individuals develop severe outcomes from infection while others do not. I approach this problem by combining large-scale human genomic data with pragmatic clinical trials. My goal is to develop and apply rigorous statistical methodologies to identify causal drivers of sepsis and infection susceptibility. By bridging the gap between theoretical genetics and bedside application, I aim to translate complex biological data into tangible improvements in patient care and clinical policy.</p>

        <h3>Trials and Translational Research</h3>
        <p>My clinical research focuses on the design and delivery of pragmatic trials to improve outcomes in severe infection. I co-lead the <a href="https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN76873478" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DEXACELL trial</a>, which evaluates the use of dexamethasone as an adjunctive therapy in cellulitis. I am also involved in the <a href="https://www.bristol-trials-centre.bristol.ac.uk/studies/aspect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASPECT trial</a>, a large randomised evaluation of aspirin for the prevention of cardiovascular events in pneumonia. This work emphasizes efficient, patient-centered study designs that allow for the rapid translation of findings into routine clinical practice.</p>

        <h3>Statistical Genetics and Methodology</h3>
        <p>I focus on the development of new statistical methodologies to analyze high-dimensional genetic data. My work utilizes novel methods in Mendelian randomization and genetic epidemiology to investigate causal drivers of disease. This involves creating robust frameworks to identify and validate functional variants that drive immune responses, ensuring that genetic associations can be confidently mapped to biological mechanisms.</p>

        <h3>Clinical Microbiology and Diagnostics</h3>
        <p>I have a strong interest in the optimization of clinical microbiology pathways and laboratory processes. I was a lead investigator on the <a href="https://www.nbt.nhs.uk/research-development/our-research/current-research/covid-19-research/covid-19-aerator-study" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AERATOR study</a>, which quantified aerosol generation during medical procedures to inform COVID-19 safety guidelines. My recent work examines the impact of pre-analytical variables—such as blood culture transport times—on diagnostic yield, as well as the utility of <a href="https://openresearch.nihr.ac.uk/articles/5-74" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">time-to-positivity</a> in predicting endocarditis. I aim to use large-scale laboratory data to refine diagnostic algorithms.</p>
