    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      I am a clinical academic working at the intersection of infectious disease medicine, statistical genetics, and clinical
      epidemiology. My research focuses on understanding why some individuals develop severe outcomes from infection while others
      do not. I approach this problem by combining large-scale human genomic data with pragmatic clinical trials. My goal is to
      develop and apply rigorous statistical methodologies to identify causal drivers of sepsis and infection susceptibility. By
      bridging the gap between theoretical genetics and bedside application, I aim to translate complex biological data into
      tangible improvements in patient care and clinical policy.

        <h3>Trials and Translational Research</h3>
        <p>
          My clinical research focuses on the design and delivery of pragmatic trials to improve outcomes in severe infection. I
          co-lead the <a href="https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN76873478" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DEXACELL trial</a>, which
          evaluates the use of dexamethasone as an adjunctive therapy in cellulitis. I am also involved in the
          <a href="https://www.bristol-trials-centre.bristol.ac.uk/studies/aspect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ASPECT trial</a>,
          a large randomised evaluation of aspirin for the prevention of cardiovascular events in pneumonia. This work emphasizes
          efficient, patient-centered study designs that allow for the rapid translation of findings into routine clinical
          practice.

        <h3>Statistical Genetics and Methodology</h3>
        <p>
          I focus on the development of new statistical methodologies to analyze high-dimensional genetic data. My work utilizes
          novel methods in Mendelian randomization and genetic epidemiology to investigate causal drivers of disease. This involves
          creating robust frameworks to identify and validate functional variants that drive immune responses, ensuring that
          genetic associations can be confidently mapped to biological mechanisms.

        <h3>Clinical Microbiology and Diagnostics</h3>
        <p>
          I have a strong interest in the optimization of clinical microbiology pathways and laboratory processes. I was a lead
          investigator on the <a href="https://www.nbt.nhs.uk/research-development/our-research/current-research/covid-19-research/covid-19-aerator-study" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AERATOR study</a>, which
          quantified aerosol generation during medical procedures to inform COVID-19 safety guidelines. My recent work examines the
          impact of pre-analytical variables—such as blood culture transport times—on diagnostic yield, as well as the utility of
          <a href="https://openresearch.nihr.ac.uk/articles/5-74" target="_blank" rel="noopener">time-to-positivity</a> in predicting
          endocarditis. I aim to use large-scale laboratory data to refine diagnostic algorithms.
